## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nft-marketplace.git
cd nft-marketplace
```

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```bash
REACT_APP_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=your_infura_project_id
REACT_APP_IPFS_API_KEY=your_ipfs_api_key
REACT_APP_NETWORK=mumbai  # or mainnet, polygon
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 4️⃣ Compile and deploy smart contracts

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai
```

### 5️⃣ Run development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the app.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Smart contract tests

Run tests to verify contract functionality and security:

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

### Frontend tests (optional)

```bash
npm run test
```

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Contracts audited using OpenZeppelin best practices.
* User wallet private keys never stored or transmitted.
* Smart contracts include reentrancy guards and input validation.
* IPFS metadata content addressed for immutability.
* Follow standard security protocols for environment secrets.
* Regular dependency audits using `npm audit`.

---

## 📈 Deployment & Production

For production deployment:

1. Use a secure Ethereum RPC provider (Infura, Alchemy).
2. Deploy contracts on mainnet or Polygon mainnet.
3. Use managed IPFS pinning services for metadata availability.
4. Host frontend on static site hosts like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS.
5. Monitor blockchain events and backend APIs for uptime.
6. Implement continuous integration & deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
